# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 19

**Evaluator: [Smith, Scott](mailto:scott@cs.jhu.edu)**


## Positive Points

* You have fleshed out the basic stuff, good!

## Needs work issues

* You didn't fully get switched to Django, see below.

## Code

* Good start but get docs hooked up.
* Why do you have a pom file when you are no longer using SparkJava.

## Code Docs

* You have Python code but are using Javadoc?  Use PyDoc and generate the docs from your Python code!

**-4 points**

## Github

* Good use of issues, get further into it for the next iteration if you can.


## Tests

* You have a start there, fill it out and get good coverage by iteration 4.  Also get Travis to run correctly.

## Build

* Include build/test instructions in your top-level repository Readme.md for iteration 4, make sure it works correctly from a freshly cloned version of your master branch.  You have them in your iteration plan and also you don't give the full recipe.  I should just copy/paste what you have and your server should run. For the front-end what you give is fine just put it at the top level.  If I do what you have now it does not include how to do any database setup and I get ```TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
could not connect to server: Connection refused.```
* You have a travis config but it is not running the tests - check the log on travis-ci.com for the error messages.  You may need to put the server at the top of the repository to get it to work cleanly.

## Iteration Plan

 * good job!


## Overall:

Congrats for getting caught up, generally things are looking good now.

**Grade: 96/100**

**+5 on iteration 2 for getting RESTful API specified**
