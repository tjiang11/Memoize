# Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 19

**Evaluator: [Smith, Scott](mailto:scott@cs.jhu.edu)**


## Positive Points:

* What you have in your document is generally good.


## Things to Improve:

* You have a good idea on having personal and organization calendars which differ, this is something not found explicitly in Google calendar for example.  But, you don't really make much distinction between the two types in the rest of your design so it ends up looking very little different from Google's current version (on Google as you probably know there is only one kind of calendar, its only public/private that may differ between organization and individual).

* The "Domain analysis" you have looks too much like the feature list.  It probably means you didn't need to do it as your domain is fairly obvious.  The kind of things a domain analysis can help with is drilling into the underlying calendar structures you are using.  For example, it might disambiguate whether organizations can have multiple calendars or not.

*-2 points*

* As we discussed, you are close to existing calendar apps and there are many libraries etc for displaying etc calendars to use so you don't have a lot of code potential now in your design.  You need to solidify / focus your app on something more distinct from a generic calendar.

*-20 points* (we will give you many of these points back if your iteration 2 addresses this issue)

### UI Sketches

* You don't fully show the organization vs user aspect of the appilication.  The different types of listings should be e.g. in different color on the calendar views (or however you are planning on showing them).

* Several items in feature list are not shown in UI sketches. You are missing sketches for how import/subscribe works, for example there is supposed to be a list of subscribed-to calendars.  The search is also not shown.  By being complete you get deeper into your app design.

*-5 points*

## Suggestions:

* We discussed some ideas on Wednesday.  The unique aspect of your app is organization calendars and you pushed in that direction you could come up with new features.  We discussed rating events after or "buzzing" them up before to show interest. Organizations often want to send event alerts, e.g. event cancelled, room changed, etc.

## Overall:

You have an idea which should be able to evolve into a good project, but you started late on getting the idea together and it put you behind on how far you got in iteration 1.
