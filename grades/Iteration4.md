# Iteration 4 Evaluation - Group 19

**Evaluator: [Smith, Scott](mailto:scott@cs.jhu.edu)**

## Code

You have what looks like a good code basis of the core CRUD.  All you need to do is fill things out now.  In particular the core novel functionality of reminders by location.

I could not get your front-end to run, not sure why.

## Tests

Your tests generally look good.  There are not many but you also have many features left to implement.  Make sure to expand the tests to other features as you flesh them out, for example modifying and deleting reminders, testing the location-based reminder aspects, etc.  

Travis is all working, great.  Note I could not run your tests for some reason, I got an error about not being able to create the test database.  Please provide instructions for running the tests in iteration 5.

**-2 points**

## Build / run / deploy

You are OK on build.  I could build and run your server but not the front-end or tests.

You need to eventually get a deployment on heroku or other site, it will also allow you to more easily test and demo the app with multiple users on actual phones.

**-5 points**

## Github

Looking very good here, nice use of issues, labels, frequent commits, etc.

## Iteration Plan

Fine.

## Code Docs

Fine.

## Overall Comments

Overall you are on a reasonable trajectory to finish with a good project.  Some of the features coming up will be more challenging because you are going to be out of the CRUD box.

**Grade: 93/100**
