#### Group Number: 19 Memoize

#### Presentation

- Interesting and well explained goals.

- Nice videos! 

##### App demo comments.  Did any errors/glitches arise during the demo?

- The demo generally went well.

- You could have used the Google routing API to estimate travel times, but you did come up with something reasonable there.


##### UI quality -- look and usability

Fine, it got the job done.

#### Iteration 6

##### Code inspection

##### Architecture - was the code cleanly structured in terms of packages, deployment, etc

Generally good -- simple but well-executed.

You should have cached location/time or used firebase push notifications to get time updates and should not be hacking around some intentional restrictions built into Android.  If you had been further along on this it would have come up in a previous iteration and you would have been able to address it.

Heroku deployment not working as of demo, but it seems to be up as of Thursday AM.

##### Tests - good coverage?  Travis working?

- Travis is working well.  You don't have a super lot of tests but you are testing some of the more advanced features and not just C-R-U-D which is good.  Plus you have great coverage.

##### Final code documentation

- Good on both front- and back-end.

#### Overall remarks

Your app was generally simple in terms of architecture and you have hardly any non-CRUD code, but you had a really good concept, did a very good job on the parts you got done, and were also a 3-person group without much experience.

Your software engineering skills showed great improvement over the class, you turned in a really nice project in terms of build, deploy, test, and use of git.  Congratulations.
