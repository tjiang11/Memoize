# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 19

**Evaluator: [Smith, Scott](mailto:scott@cs.jhu.edu)**


## Positive Points:

* Your domain analysis is now a domain analysis.
* You are closing in on a sensible app.

## Things to Improve:

* The UML should try to be more object-based by making an Admin object as that role has specific actions associated with it which are now all on the User class.

* Your UIs don't show all the features

* You did not give a specification for your RESTful interface as required in the assignment.
  *-10 points*  but you can get some of these back if you add them to iteration 3.

* You could have gotten further with your prototyping, for example getting an endpoint for user login.  Only a minor ding.  *-2 points*


### UI Sketches

* Your UI sketches are much improved, but they don't fully line up with the features you will need.  There is no way to add a group event. It is not clear how you are going to populate your database of Hopkins locations.  Show the "drop pin" method for addiing a location - I assume you are going to use the Google maps API so show how it can work - ? *-5 points*


## Overall:

You are much improved from iteration 1 and while you are a bit behind still you are catching up.


**Grade: 83/100**

**+12 to your iteration 1 submission for focusing your application**
